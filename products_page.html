            <h2 class="title">Slim Fit <span>Suits</span></h2>
            <p>This type of suit for men gets you a stylish, form-fitting style suit that’s narrow at the chest and waist, but not to the point of constricting blood flow. While slim fit suits and athletic builds seem like an obvious pairing, the truth is that many different male body types can pull off the slim fit look.</p>

              <h2 class="title">Modern Fit <span>Suits</span></h2>
              <p>These types of suits for men hover squarely in the realm between slim fit and a classic fit. It thereby delivers a tight look with breathing room to spare. If you get the material and the accessories right then you can make this work for just about any occasion. Modern suit styles are made to conquer any outing, from casual to dressy.</p>

              <h2 class="title">Single Vent <span> Suits</span></h2>
              <p>The vent is that small slit you notice on the backside of a blazer or jacket. When the vent is cut up the middle, it’s known as a centre vent. With a centre vent, the suit jacket tends to part slightly when your hands are in your pockets, sometimes exposing your back. Otherwise, the centre vent should remain closed when you’re wearing the jacket. If the vent is parted when you’re hands aren’t in your pockets, it means your jacket is the wrong fit.</p>

              <h2 class="title">Double Vent <span>Suits</span></h2>
              <p>As the name implies, side vents cut the slit on both sides to keep the jacket from parting or bunching when you put your hands in your pockets or take a seat. The wide middle flap not only keeps your back covered but prevents creasing and retains a slimmer appearance.</p>

              <h2 class="title">No Vent <span>Suits</span></h2>
              <p>Popular in Italy, the no vent style suit offers elegant style and a custom fit. However, without any vents, the jacket itself is more prone to creasing or bunching when you put your hands in your pockets or sit down. This style is best suited to tuxedoes.</p>

              <h2 class="title">Cuffed <span> Pants</span></h2>
              <p>When it comes to the suit trouser styles, they’ll either be hemmed or cuffed at the bottom. Hemmed means the bottom fabric is turned up on the inside, while cuffed means the bottom fabric is turned up on the outside. Both styles are popular, though you’re more likely to see hemmed than cuffed. The general rule of thumb is that flat-front pants should be hemmed and pleated pants should be cuffed, but it’s a loose rule at best.</p>

            <h2 class="title">Flat Front<span> Pants</span></h2>
            <p>A standard among men’s pants, flat front pants are pretty much what they sound like. That is, the fabric lies flat at the front and delivers a slim, tight fit. You can wear flat-front pants a little lower on the waistline to rock a stylish, slender silhouette. Naturally, if you’re packing some extra weight in the stomach area, then you might consider going with a roomier pant style to better conceal that hard-earned beer belly.</p>

          <div class="text-content">
            <h2 class="title">Pleated Front<span> Pants</span></h2>
            <p>Pleats are creases on both sides at the front of the pants, which result from the material being folded and sewed before it’s attached to the waistband. Consequently, this suit style is looser in the middle and best worn slightly above the hip to avoid billowing out at the thighs. </p>
